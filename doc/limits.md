# Limits

The following items are known to not necessarily work:

* [Some template
  files](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/issues/42#issuecomment-1426727973) -
  these are often not strictly speaking Clojure, though they look pretty close
* [ClojureCLR's pipe syntax for
  symbols](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/issues/35#issuecomment-1407320526)
  ([comment at #42](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/issues/42#issuecomment-1450290140))
* [Files that contain one or more
  zero-bytes](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/issues/42#issuecomment-1430546851)

See [#42](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/issues/42) for
more details.
